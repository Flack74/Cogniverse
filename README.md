# Cogniverse 🌌✨

**Cogniverse** is a full-stack project (Go backend + React frontend) aiming to merge a **productivity suite** and a **personal portfolio** into one sleek platform. Currently, the **Focus Music** feature is done—but there's **much more** to come!

## Project Vision 🚀

- **Backend (Go)**: Will eventually store and retrieve data from a **PostgreSQL** database.  
- **Frontend (React)**: Showcases a collaborative and interactive UI.  
- **Focus Music**: Done! Relax with curated lofi/instrumental beats. (Planned group sessions too!)  
- **Game (Multiplayer)**: A fun break-time feature to challenge friends.  
- **Leaderboard (Collaborative)**: Rank up in tasks, games, or any other metric.  
- **Tasks (Collaborative)**: Manage tasks with real-time collaboration.  
- **Stats (Collaborative)**: Track your productivity and progress.  
- **Notes (Save Notes)**: Keep your ideas and to-dos organized.  
- **Dashboard**: Display user information, stats, achievements.  
- **Portfolio**: Show off your projects, skills, and achievements.
